# Search Queries Anomaly Detection using Python
 This project implements anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in search query data. By analyzing search queries, the system can detect outliers that may indicate irregular user behavior, system issues, or potential security threats. The project utilizes Python libraries for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models to classify and visualize anomalies in search query logs.
